ERCore 7.x
ERCore module for the Drupal (http://drupal.org) to assist with NSF EPSCoR 
reporting This module aims to provide a generic platform for Universities to 
collect information about research and funding outcomes including: publications, 
proposals, collaborations, external engagements, etc. The module is being 
developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements of NSF's EPSCoR 
Grants.
This module is not intended for general purpose use, though you are welcome to 
try it out and adapt it to your own use.
The Developer manual will provide your IT specialists with the information they 
need to implement a new instance of the ERcore for your jurisdiction. 
The Administrator manual will provide your EPSCoR staff with instructions on 
how to set up and use the reporting system. On installation of the ERcore you 
will need to make choices about how the site will collect, handle and display 
your data. Working together, the manuals provide an easy, step-by-step process 
for spinning up a customized data management system for your NSF EPSCoR reporting.
You may also want to contact one of the EPSCoR jurisdictions already using the 
ERCore to answer your questions and provide guidance.
